We chose the theme Ed-Tech and have incorporated structural/ functional inefficiencies we as student encounter in the various ed tech platform available in the market. Our aim is to make the experience student friendly and assist them in their hectic schedule by keeping the UI quite minimalistic and easy to navigate through. The website will have integrated the functions of many platforms into one software-class links, resources, assignment tracker, performance tracker.
The student can login by creating an account or sign-in with google as well. Then s/he is directed to the main dashboard where s/he can track all the activities at one place. We have further created a section called Courses for students to track their assignments schedule for each subject they have enrolled in and see the evaluation policy as well. Forum is another section added to serve as a common place for all doubts. 
A distinguishing feature we have added is the CGPA where the student can easily be aware of the approximate CGPA s/he is scoring till now. This will be highly beneficial to the students as they can plan their work accordingly.
